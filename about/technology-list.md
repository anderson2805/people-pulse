The technology domains summarized here are based on various perspectives noted by the NATO Science and Technology Organization (STO) in their report ["Science & Technology Trends 2023-2043."](https://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pdf/2023/3/pdf/stt23-vol2.pdf)

It's important to note that these technology domains are not exhaustive and may change as new technologies emerge and existing ones evolve. The domains aim to provide a broad overview of key areas in technological development likely to shape the future of science and technology. This summary takes into account the perspectives of the following councils:

- US: National Science and Technology Council (NSTC)
- US: Department of Defense (Research and Engineering)
- EU: European Commission (EC) - Joint Research Center (JRC)
- EU: European Defence Agency - Capability Technology Areas (CapTechs) and the Overarching Strategic Research Agenda (OSRA) Technology Building Blocks (TBB)

An alternative framework to consider is based on the NATO classification of research areas, as outlined in their ["2024 Collaborative Programme of Work."](https://www.sto.nato.int/public/20240506_UC_IKM_NATO-science-and-technology-organization-2024-collaborative-programme-of-work.pdf)
